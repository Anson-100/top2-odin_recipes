      According to the website from which I found this recipe, this is supposed to be the world's best lasagna. Perhaps this picture doesn't do the recipe justice but sometimes it is what is on the inside that really counts. However, perhaps the person who submitted this photo didn't do the recipe justice either. Over 2200 people submitted a photo of their attempt at pulling off this recipe so, statistically speaking, I am sure some of these photos are of horrible lasagna. That being said, as long as you follow the following recipe with patience, precision, and focus I am sure you and everyone else at your table will be thoroughly pleased with your culinary masterpiece.

            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
            <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>16oz ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>3/4lb mozarella cheese, sliced</li>
            <li>3/4 cup grated parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>
        directions
    </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water. Season with sugar, basil, fennel seeds, Italian seasoning, 1 teaspoon salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons parsley. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third of mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I would include the nutrition info but I am tired of working on this project and I kind of resent this recipe for having so many ingredients.</p>
