            Toast another quick, easy, and extremely versatile food that is typically associated with breakfast. This makes sense because breakfast is consumed in the morning (usually) and convenience is paramount when you have limited time to prepare and consume a meal before stepping outside taking on the day. One of the coolest features of toast is the fact it can be eaten on the go with minamal risk of making a mess unless the toast looks like the piece in the bottom right corner of the picture above. The darker the toast, the less of it you will actually eat because there will be so many crumbs. This is probably a good thing because, no matter what anyone tells you, burnt toast is not suitable for human consumption.

            Get some bread and put it in the toaster. Adjust settings to desired level of toastiness and then push the slider thing down. If you don't have a toaster you can just use the broil setting on your oven to get the job done. After the toast is ready, add whatever toppings you desire. It is considered best practice to have said toppings ready to be added to the toast as soon as it pops out of the toaster. Adding butter, jelly, avocado, egg, or whatever else to a cold piece of toasted bread just kills the vibe.
