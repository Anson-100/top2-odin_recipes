        <p>
            Pour cereal of choice into a bowl and then add desired amount of milk. Although it is common knowledge, it is always good to reiterate the cereal is supposed to be poured into the bowl before the milk and not the other way around. It is easier to achieve the perfect cereal to milk ratio if the amount of milk in the bowl is based on the amount of cereal. After all, it is called a bowl of cereal, not a bowl of milk. It only makes sense the cereal should be added first.
